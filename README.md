# Unbeatable Tic Tac Toe Game
Welcome to my Tic Tac Toe game, a project I developed during my first semester as a programming challenge. I was challenged by my teacher to create a version of Tic Tac Toe that was unbeatable, and I succeeded! Even my teacher, who had previously used techniques to beat other students' games, couldn't defeat it.

## About
This project represents one of my earliest programming challenges where I demonstrated my problem-solving skills and determination to tackle difficult tasks. Despite being one of my first projects, it showcases my ability to think critically and devise strategic solutions to complex problems.

I discovered a research paper outlining the optimal Tic Tac Toe strategy. Leveraging insights from this paper, I developed algorithms that analyze the game state and select moves ensuring either victory or a draw. While the current strategy effectively prevents losses, there is room for enhancement to maximize wins over draws.

## Limitations
It's important to note that this project represents one of my earliest programming endeavors, and as such, the code may not be optimized or follow best practices. If I were to revisit this project today, I would implement several improvements.

## Conclusion
Despite its imperfections, this Tic Tac Toe game serves as a testament to my passion for programming and my willingness to take on challenges head-on. I am confident that my skills have evolved since then, and I am excited about the opportunity to tackle even more complex projects.
